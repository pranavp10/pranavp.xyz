## What are react hooks?

Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don't work inside classes — they let you use React without classes.

<Info description="In React, state is a built-in object that allows components to store data that may change over time. When the state changes, the component re-renders to reflect the updated data." title="What is State in React?" iconName="bulb" color="!text-[#59C5DE]"/>

## Benefits of using React Hooks

1. Cleaner code:
   - Hooks make your code more concise and easier to read, especially for components with complex state logic.
2. Better organization:
   - Hooks allow you to group related logic together, making your components more organized and maintainable.
3. Improved reusability:
   - Hooks are just functions, so you can easily reuse them across different components.
